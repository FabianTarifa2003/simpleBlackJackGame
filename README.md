## How to Play

1. Click the "Start Game" button to begin.

3. Based on the card sum:
    - If the sum is less than 21, you can choose to draw another card.
    - If the sum is exactly 21, you win with a Blackjack!
    - If the sum exceeds 21, you're out of the game.
4. The game resets after a Blackjack is achieved.
